#Surveyor in Ruby

What you'll find in this little directory is some code that was generated using the `bundle gem` command from the Bundler gem. This code is the code for an (imaginary) gem called "surveyor", which helps represent survey data within Ruby.

The two main sub-directories we would like to highlight are `spec` and `lib`.

The `spec` directory contains some [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) tests.
